Web development is about developing and maintaining websites for various purposes like making info accessible to clients.

HTML - HyperText Markup Language, this is basically the skeleton of the websites, used to structure content on the web page like text and images

CSS - Cascading Style Sheets, this makes the websites look good by styling the HTML, eg by adding colors and fonts to the texts.

Javascript - it is a programming language that adds functionality to the website, eg form validation and sometimes animations

Node.js - a javascript runtime that allows javascript to run and be executed outside of the browser allowing for server-side development
